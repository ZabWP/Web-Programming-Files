      Arguably, snake season is year-round in Arizona, a state known for its
      rattlers. But baby rattlesnakes are born in July and August, making these
      two months especially dangerous for hikers, gardeners, children and others

      So far this year, 74 rattlesnake bites to humans have been reported to the
      Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center. Based at the University of

      Specialists answering the phones at the center regularly receive calls
      from Arizonans of all ages who don't realize they were bitten by a

      pinch or bite while outdoors to immediately call the center at
      800-222-1222.

      snakebite or eliminate it," said Keith Boesen, director of the Arizona
      Poison and Drug Information Center. "With snakebite, the sooner the
      medical treatment, the better the outcome, so calling us right away can
      make a very big difference for the victims and the medical teams treating
      them."
